# To-Do-List
A To-Do List application made with Python is a practical and user-friendly tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently
To-Do List Application: Console-Based Interface using Python Programming Language
This is a pretty simple task-managing application written in Python, which should be run from the console. The application provides functionality for easy adding of new tasks, looking through the existing ones, updating information about one's tasks, and deleting those that are not needed anymore, right from the command line. That makes it an extremely lightweight solution for people who either prefer or have a need for a text-based interface over more graphical options.
Features:

Task Management:
Users can input new tasks into their list, view the entire list of tasks that are in the process, mark tasks that need to be finished and can also delete tasks that are no longer needed.

Each individual task gives a full description of the details involved, and there is also an optional due date if that's preferred.
Persistent Storage:
The tasks are stored in a secured local file. For the storage, JSON is often used to do the formatting. In this approach, the complete task listing will be kept safe and intact across the different user sessions.

User Interaction:
The program features a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that actually prompts for the user's input while guiding them through a set of operations concerning adding new tasks, viewing tasks, updating information about tasks, and deleting those that are not needed anymore.

Task Prioritization:
Tasks can be set to different priority levels, such as high, medium, and low, which in turn allows users to focus on the most important ones.

Due Dates and Reminders:
The users can set due dates for the particular tasks, which in turn helps them to keep track of when a deadline will be due.

The application can highlight tasks that are overdue or approaching their due dates.
The process of categorization and filtration:
Tasks could be categorized or grouped into several different types, which could include work-related activities, personal things to do, things to buy, and so on and so forth.

Users can filter the tasks on certain categories, priority levels, or completion status.
Technical Implementation:
The To-Do List application leverages the standard libraries of Python to handle files, I/O operations, and JSON serialization. The high-level overview of its implementation is as follows:
Initialisation:

At the very beginning of its process, the application attempts to load a set of tasks from the JSON file-if that file exists. Otherwise, not finding the file or it does not exist, it falls back to initializing an empty list of tasks.

Menu-Driven Interface:
Now, the user is presented with a menu that includes options such as adding a new task, listing all previous tasks, marking some of them as finished, being able to delete those that are not pending, and the last option should be for the exit when the user has completed their tasks.

Task Operations:

Add Task: It prompts the user for a task description, due date, and priority level. View Tasks: Lists all tasks with filters for the task's category, priority, and status.  Update Task: This feature gives the user the ability to edit anything on an already existing task, from its description and due date to priority on that particular task. Remove Task: This action involves taking away a specific task from the list, which is determined by the input provided by the user. Save Tasks: Saves the current list of tasks in a JSON file. Data Persistence: Tasks are persisted to a file (tasks.json) using JSON serialization. After restart, the application reads tasks from the file, in order to restore previously It is an exceptionally simple yet effective way to undertake several tasks, manage them effectively, and meet some deadlines through a To-Do List application developed in the Python programming language and executed from the console environment. Its simplicity makes it very user-friendly but keeps several other key functionalities such as task prioritization and setting due dates for the tasks, and the list remains stored even when the application is closed. In particular, this application is truly instrumental for any person who is looking to increase their productivity without needing to deal with Graphical User Interface.
